  <h1>Brief History of CSS</h1>
    <p><span class="date-year">1994:</span> The first work on style sheets started at CERN.</p>
    <p><span class="date-year">December 1996:</span> CSS was proposed as W3C standard:</p>
    <blockquote>CSS1 defines the language in which style sheets are written
    and a set of properties that designers can use to describe
    how documents should be presented. The properties in CSS1
    cover the most common screen-based presentations.

    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="date-year">November 1997:</span> The W3C released the first public CSS2
      Working Draft.</p>
    <p><b>New features:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li id="first">Ability to specify how a document should be spoken when
          rendering HTML with a speech synthesizer.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>You can specify how loudly a phrase should be spoken,
              where pauses should be, voice characteristics, and where
              one speaker is physically in relation to others (for
              stereo effects.)</li>
          </ul>
          <li>You can insert sound clips before and after elements,
              for instance, to emphasize hypertext links.</li>
          <li>More complex positioning of text, images and other
              elements on the page.</li>
          <li>You can position text in a box within a paragraph.</li>
          <li>You can position and "layer" material as though it was written on
              acetate sheets one on top of each other: most kinds of
              layout which are commonly found in magazines and other
              printed material are possible with CSS2.</li>
          <li>You can specify styles for printing and other media.</li>
          <ul class="info">
            <li>Stylesheet for printing on paper may need to be
              different from one for presenting information on a screen.</li>
            <li>CSS2 lets authors associate different stylesheets
              for different media with the same document.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Authors can control page breaks.</li>
          <li>Has widow and orphan control, just as for ordinary
          desktop publishing.</li>
          <li>For high-quality printing, crop marks can be
          printed outside the outer edges of the page box.</li>
          <li>Better specification of fonts for a document.</li>
            <ul class="unique">
              <li>Font information can be used to download font subsets
                over the Web.</li>
              <li>Font information can be used to download font subsets
                  over the Web.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
      <p><span class="date-year">May 1998:</span> CSS2 specification becomes a W3C
        recommendation.</p>
      <p><span class="date-year">2000:</span> Work on CSS3 was under way.</p>
      <blockquote>CSS3 will, in effect, have all of the
        features that users expect from a desktop publishing
        environment, as well as a range of features especially
        suited to the context of an international and multimedia
        Web.</blockquote>
      <p>CSS3 will also be modularized. For example, there
        might be one module consisting of properties having to
        do with fonts and text, and another module for properties
        concerned with colors, and so on.</p>
