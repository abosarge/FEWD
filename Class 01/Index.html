<h1>Tina Belcher</h1>

<blockquote>"I'm a smart, strong, sensual woman."</blockquote>

<p><img src="images/Bobs_Burgers_Tina_Belcher_Butt_Toucher.jpg" class="topimage">
  Tina Ruth Belcher is the oldest child. She is a hopeless romantic with a
  powerful sex drive and minimal social skills. She likes horses, rainbows,
  zombies, writing erotic fiction, and movies, as was revealed in Crawl Space.
  She attends Wagstaff School with her siblings, Gene Belcher and Louise
  Belcher. She is voiced by Dan Mintz.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>

<p>Tina's personality in essence is a quirky girl transitioning from childhood
  to adolescence. The child in her still clings to her love for horses,
  rainbows, and zombies while her inner teenager calls her to fantasize about
  zombies making out, writing her feelings/activities in her diary, to write
  erotic fiction whether it be about friends or other people's works, and
  constantly think about her crush, Jimmy Pesto, Jr., along with anyone else
  she deems cute like an entire baseball team of twenty-five for example.</p>

<p>Like-wise Tina has little to no social skills. When voting who would serve
  a customer they thought was a child molester, Bob says they shouldn't let
  Tina serve him because she is bad with customers. Louise says that it isn't
  her fault because she's autistic, but they are immediately contradicted by
  their father. Whether she is autistic or not she still displays poor social
  skills whether it be her prolonged groaning when under pressure, hiding under
  tables, being a naïve, or taking things very literally.</p>

<p>Also, Tina doesn't show emotions or emote well. Even when times are
    rough and she's under tremendous amounts of pressure, her voice is always
    inflectionless, even her groans are disinterested. The only exception is
    when she crashes a car, lies to an insurance company (which she feels
    incredibly guilty about), and burns down a man's house is when her tone
    actually shows a little emotion from all the pressure she had endured thus
    far. After that she begins to emote better, a little more frequently.</p>

<p>Despite most teenage girls wanting to be like each other and their self-worth
  dwindling because of it, she has quite a bit of confidence and self-worth.
  Initially, she conforms to the peer-pressure of shaving her legs, but regrets
  it when reflecting on how she did it for the wrong reasons. Then when
  discussing with her Dad on self-confidence she says that she believed that
  she was beautiful and became so and he should too. And to further attest to
  her self confidence, she considers herself to be a smart, strong, sensual
  woman.</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>

<p>Tina, like the rest of the Belcher family, has slightly tan skin and black
  hair. She wears her hair in a bob style with uneven bangs across the front
  and a yellow hairclip. Like her mother, Tina's eyesight is impaired and she
  wears glasses to correct the problem.</p>

<p>Tina's usual attire consists of a light blue t-shirt, a navy blue skirt,
  white tube socks with a red stripe, and black high top sneakers that resemble
  Chuck Taylor All-Stars. In more formal situations, Tina has a purple dress
  and black shoes. She sleeps in a light purple top with grey bottoms and
  occasionally slippers.</p>

<h2>Love Interests</h2>

<p>Jimmy Pesto Jr.<br />
In every episode with Jimmy Jr. it's shown that Tina likes him, and according
to Tina she has logged over 3000 fantasy hours with him and "You don't just
throw that away!"</p>

<p>Nathan<br />
In Beefsquatch, Tina meets Nathan at a recording of Get On Up with Chuck and
Pam. He has a weird crush on Pam and uses her to try and get close to Pam.</p>

<p>Josh<br />
In Two for Tina, Tina decides to go to the dance with Josh, the boy she met
lurking in the dairy case at Fresh Feed in Lindapendent Woman.</p>

<p>Jonas<br />
In Uncle Teddy, Tina falls for the new delivery boy at Reggie's Deli who
plays the melodica.</p>

<p>Jeff<br />
Jeff was an easy breezy shoe box with the name "Jeff" on him that appeared in
Tina and the Real Ghost. Tina thought Jeff was a ghost who lived inside the
box, but it turned out that Louise tricked her in to thinking he was a 13 year
old boy. Took Jeff to many places such as Wonder Wharf and a Butterfly Exibit.</p>

<h2>Trivia</h2>

<ul>
<li>In the early production days of Bob's Burgers, Tina was originally a boy
  named Daniel, named after Dan Mintz. Later on, however, the staff felt like
  it wouldn't work, so they changed the sex of the character and gave the
  character a new name: Tina (though Mintz could still voice Tina as the
  producers that it could pass as an awkward teenage puberty voice).</li>

<li>Tina is a member of Thundergirls troop 119.</li>

<li>Tina was originally 12 at the beginning of the series, she celebrates her
  13th birthday in Sheesh! Cab, Bob?</li>

<li>Tina is in eighth grade as revealed in Adventures In Chinchilla-sitting.</li>

<li>Has size 8½ feet. <em>(God Rest Ye Merry Gentle-Mannequins)</em></li>

<li>Tina is left-handed. She can be seen writing erotic friend fiction with
  her left hand in Bad Tina and playing a left-handed guitar in The Frond Files.
</li>

<li>Participated in the ice bucket challenge to raise money for ALS research.
She nominates Paul Rudd, Chris Harrison and Scott Van Slyke from the Los
Angeles Dodgers baseball team because all of whom would look good in a wet
t-shirt. Incidentally, Paul Rudd is lined up to voice her imaginary horse
friend, Jericho in The Horse Rider-er.</li>
